# automated-rocket-controller
ðŸš€  A series of scripted autopilot controllers for rocket simulation

This repository contains code which attempts to automate various space flight manuevars and operations - such as launching, entering orbit, collecting science and landing.
The code is interpreted by an simulated on-board computer within a spacecraft simulator application.

To demonstrate these automated routines without requring the simulator, I am building a visualizer which accurately renders the SOI and the flight path of the spacecraft.
Data for the visualizer will be recorded using the GPS software written to run on a seperate simulated on-board computer.

Here's a demonstration of the most recent progress on the visualizer (WIP):
